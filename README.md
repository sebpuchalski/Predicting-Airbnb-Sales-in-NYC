# Predicting-Airbnb-Sales-in-NYC
The following notebook showcases my analysis of AirBnB listings dataset originally posted on Kaggle by Dgomonov. 
The listings were scrapped on July 8th 2019 and are specific to NYC, NY.  
Link to the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data  

The objective of the analysis is to:  
-estimate listing price based on provided information 
-understand if any listings may be over or underpriced 
-derive additional useful and interesting insights

The Machine Learning part of the project is in progress
