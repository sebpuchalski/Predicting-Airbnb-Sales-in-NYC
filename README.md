The objective of the analysis is to:

- derive additional useful and interesting insights


Part 1 deals with taking the existing dataset, performing data cleaning, feature engineering and running preliminary analysis. The product of this part is a data file for Machnie Learning analysis.

Part 2 - The Machine Learning part of the project applies machine learning algorithms to predict price of lisings based on various input variables.
