# Predicting Price of Airbnb Listings in NYC
The following notebook showcases my analysis of AirBnB listings dataset originally posted on Kaggle by Dgomonov. 
The listings were scrapped on July 8th 2019 and are specific to NYC, NY.  
Link to the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data  

The objective of the analysis is to:  
-estimate listing price based on provided information 
-understand if any listings may be over or underpriced 
-derive additional useful and interesting insights

The first part (NYC Airbnb Data Preparation and Analysis) deals with taking the existing dataset, performing data cleaning, feature engineering and preliminary analysis. The product of this part is a data file for Machnie Learning analysis.

The Machine Learning part of the project (NYC Airbnb ML in progress) applies machine learning algorithms to predict price of lising based on various input variables. This part of the project is partially completed, but still in progress.
